For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.



## Requirements
- OpenAI key
- Conda

## Configuration
Add a `.autoconfig-config` file in the root directory with the following content in JSON format:

```json

    "api_key": "Your OpenAI Key"
}
```

## Notes
- The extension has not been tested on Windows, because the path of Python interperter in Windows is magical and so does it in conda envs.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
